# RestoBill

An app which waiters at a restaurant can use to keep track of tables, orders, products, ...

Synchronisation server can be found in `etc/server/` folder. Can be run with the command `php -S <IP Address>:8000`. PHP obviously needs to be installed for this. `<IP Address>` needs to be `127.0.0.1` in case the app is run in an emulator, in which case the server IP entered into the app should be `10.0.2.2`.

Made in a couple of days for the AIB DataHack hackathon.
